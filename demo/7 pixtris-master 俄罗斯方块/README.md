## Credits

Blocks art style inspired by fantastic works of [VGPerlers](https://www.etsy.com/shop/VGPerlers),
in particular their [Tetris Pieces](https://www.etsy.com/listing/169319291/tetris-pieces-set-of-7-perler-bead)

Some basic implementation ideas inspired
by [Javascript Tetris](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/javascript-tetris/)
on [Code inComplete](http://codeincomplete.com/).

Last but not least, [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com/) docs and good folks
at (HTML5 Game Devs)[http://www.html5gamedevs.com/] forums.
